You are going to create a menu for a restaurant using html and CSS. I am uploading a file for the style NOT THE CONTENT of the menu.
Each Item should have title, description, picture and price. Make sure to correctly use section tags.  For instance all your sandwiches should be in a section.  Remember good html and css looks good but also conveys good meaning from the html.
